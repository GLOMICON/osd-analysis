# Customizing

Initially took a [*cayman* theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman).

General [guide on customizing themes](
https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/)
 
* Copied cayman default layout to `_layouts/default.html`
* Added `assets/css/style.scss for initial customization.

## Navigation

Added navigation bases on data.

See [short summary](http://planetjekyll.github.io/snippets/nav-with-data.html) and [jekyll tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/navigation/) describing the approach.

Styling adopted from [this page](https://medialoot.com/blog/how-to-create-a-responsive-navigation-menu-using-only-css/) with pure CSS and better positioning [using these hints](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp).
